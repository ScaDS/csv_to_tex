# csv to tex
This repository contains [a notebook](curate_and_convert_lectures.ipynb) that is capable of converting a CSV file containing lectures/seminars to a tex file. It also filters out incomplete data and lectures from wrong semester etc. An [example csv file](lectures_seminars.csv) is given as well.

Feedback is welcome, e.g. as [github issue](https://github.com/ScaDS/csv_to_tex/issues).
